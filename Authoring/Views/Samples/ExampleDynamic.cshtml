@inherits TemplateBase<dynamic>

# Welcome

Welcome to the @Model.Name Zoo. We're very glad that you were able to make it. Please enjoy the facilities provided.

## Employees

Here is a list of our current employees:
@foreach (var staffMember in Model.Staff)
{
@:- Employee:
 @:@(Partial("_staff.cshtml", staffMember, options: new SadRazorEngine.Runtime.PartialOptions(){ InheritColumn = true}))
}

@* Example: explicit indent amount (useful from non-call-site scenarios or previews) *@
@* @(await PartialAsync("_staff.cshtml", options: new SadRazorEngine.Runtime.PartialOptions { IndentAmount = 4 })) *@

@* Note: the static helper TemplateHelpers.Partial/PartialAsync can be used here as well,
   but InheritColumn is only honored when the partial is invoked from a compiled template
   (i.e., not when invoked from a manually-authored program loop or preview environment). *@
